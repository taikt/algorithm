1. Intruction
- Example to build shared lib with makefile

- Example how to link a shared lib for another shared lib
(not link between static libs, not link between different type lib i.e c lib to cpp lib)

- In executable file, makefile include 'parent' shared lib is enouhg, 'child' shared lib is automatically called.
but if calling a function directly from 'child' shared lib, executable file must include child lib in makefile.

- need copy lib to /lib, otherwise use -Wl,.rpath

2. Refer
~/work/gen11/liblgeini_code/Makefile

3. TODO
a shared lib links a staticlib (in static lib's makefile, add -fPIC in CFLAG or CPPFLAG)
